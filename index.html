The idea was simple: every day, we release a prompt and a hashtag.  The winner is the video with the most retweets in 24 hours.  The festival has been discontinued but this is a snapshot.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">$(".item.boring").on('click', function(){
