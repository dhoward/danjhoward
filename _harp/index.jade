        p Southern California native, software developer, and owner of a very nice Kenneth Cole briefcase.  I wear a lot of hats. And I mean that literally, not in the lame cliche way people use in an attempt to make their boring lives seem interesting.  I actually like hats, a lot.
        p Feel free to grab a beer and stay a while. Actually grab one either way, because I'm just that kind of guy.
