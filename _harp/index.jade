              | My first gig as a real web developer; I worked on an agile team to build a professional social network in Ruby on Rails.
              | I was responsible for full-stack implementation of many core features and found my interests lay more in the front end, which is how I ended up with my role at Originate.

            p For you fantasy football fans out there. I made this for myself, but maybe some of you will think it's useful too. Use it to rank players how you want, and then mark them off as theyre drafted and keep track of which ones you've taken.

            p Vine had just come out and we thought it was going to be the next big thing (we were wrong, it was Instagram).  The idea was simple: every day, we release a prompt and a hashtag.  The winner is the video with the most retweets in 24 hours.  The festival has been discontinued but this is a snapshot.
